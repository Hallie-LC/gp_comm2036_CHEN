                        <div class="text3">Microsoft plans to invest US$2.9 billion to build data centers in Japan, which is the largest amount of investment Microsoft has ever made in Japan. The generative AI market has grown by approximately 20% globally, and the Japanese market is second only to the United States and China. Microsoft will equip Japanese data centers with semiconductors suitable for artificial intelligence development to provide computing power support. This move aims to strengthen Japan's cloud service system, while providing AI-related skills training to promote the growth of domestic data center demand in Japan. Microsoft's investment also involves cooperation with the Japanese government on cybersecurity and data privacy protection. The Japanese government restricts the cross-border transfer of personal data through the Personal Information Protection Act, while encouraging domestic data management. Microsoft also cooperates with OpenAI in the United States to develop generative AI products and provides related technical support in Japan. In the future, Japan will be committed to establishing its own cloud service system to cope with the growing demand for data centers.</div>
